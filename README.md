## Hi, I’m Euodia (Sose).

I’m a second-year Artificial Intelligence student with a strong interest in applied machine learning, model evaluation, and responsible AI systems.

I work primarily in Python and enjoy building end-to-end ML pipelines, comparing models, and analyzing generalization performance across real-world datasets.

Current interests:
- Applied Machine Learning
- Model Evaluation & Generalization
- Responsible AI

GitHub showcases selected academic and independent projects.
